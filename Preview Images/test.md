# System Malfunction Weapon Soundpack

**NOTE:** Thanks to all of you, my **Hornу Kraber Reload Sound mod** has reached over **1200+** downloads. This means that many people are **currently using it.** I attached a new kraber sound that should normally be included in this mod to my post on **#northstar-client-mods.** Because it would be too complicated to tell people "if you want to use the new kraber sound included this mod, you have to delete the other one first or they will conflict" So if you want to use it instead of Horny Reload, go to Northstar discord and find the post. Or alternatively ping me.

### About System Malfunction Soundpack:

* This mod changes **all weapons** reload sounds (4 different reload sounds & all randomized)
* **I STRONGLY** recommend to use **S2YMI's AmmoText Mod with this pack to have collective theme!**
* [**Click here for Sy2mi's AmmoText Mod**](https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/S2Mods/AmmoText/)
* **For example;**
These sounds are futuristic, glitchy-failure like sounds. And my low ammo alert is "Not Responding!" and reload text is "System Rebooting..." I believe you understand my point.

### And as an extra addition there are couple custom fire sounds for:

* Kraber
* EPG
* Softball
* Charge Rifle
* DMR
* Double-Take
* Thunderbolt (Lightning Sound)
* Wingman
* Wingman B3

**An additional note about Thunderbolt's sound:** I was just experimenting and liked the lightning sound so I didn't remove it, if you don't like it just simply **delete all 4 files start with this 'weapon_arclauncher_fire_1p'**

Thanks DINOTICK (DINOTICK#6969) for letting me use his sound for Kraber.

And my new cool friend Dichak (Dichak#8832) who made the rest of the sounds. He's a talented sound maker.
