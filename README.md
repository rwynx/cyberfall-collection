# Cyberfall Collection (weapon sounds and stuff will be added in the future)

# What is it?
 This is the first release of Cyberfall Collection. It contains 3 Cyberpunk themed background and Cyberpunk OST as Main Menu & MP Lobby music. A couple weapon sounds will be added in the future. I still cant figure out how to sync them :clueless:

# Can't decide and want a preview?
 ***THESE ARE ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS, THE ONES YOU SEE RIGHT NOW ARE JUST SCREENSHOTS!***

 There's a folder in the archieve called **"Previews"** there you can find **"video previews"** of all 3 backgrounds. But i'll leave image version of them here to give you example:
